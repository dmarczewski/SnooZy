###Battery Saver and Power Connection History

SnooZy Charger is a Power Connection manager. The app turns off the screen on power connection or disconnection, to save battery consumption by the phone's display. 

SnooZy can also be used as an auto-lock on unplug or simply as for power connection history. 

This app can be useful to save battery when using a **solar charger**, where power connectivity relies on weather conditions!

It was initially developed as a fix for battery drain issues on **Samsung Galaxy Nexus**: some devices randomly detect a power connection without any charger being actually connected to the phone. 
This would drain the battery because of the screen turning on to display the "Charging" message, multiple times per hour till screen timeout.

##Features
* Lightweight background service detecting power connection/disconnection.
* Power connection history saved in local database.
* Receive notifications with/out sound or vibration.
* Supports phones and tablets running Android 4.0 or later (API 14).

This app does NOT manage any other phone functionalities, such as WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS, etc. There are other apps for thatâ€¦
