{"name":"Snoozy Charger","tagline":"Android Power Connection manager","body":"##SnooZy Charger - Android Power Connection manager\r\n\r\n[![SnooZy Charger][img_github]][link_snoozy_playstore]\r\n\r\n###Battery Saver and Power Connection History\r\n\r\nSnooZy Charger is a Power Connection manager. The app turns off the screen on power connection or disconnection, to save battery consumption by the phone's display. \r\n\r\nSnooZy can also be used as an auto-lock on unplug or simply as for power connection history. \r\n\r\nThis app can be useful to save battery when using a **solar charger**, where power connectivity relies on weather conditions!\r\n\r\nIt was initially developed as a fix for battery drain issues on **Samsung Galaxy Nexus**: some devices randomly detect a power connection without any charger being actually connected to the phone. \r\nThis would drain the battery because of the screen turning on to display the \"Charging\" message, multiple times per hour till screen timeout.\r\n\r\n##Features\r\n* Lightweight background service detecting power connection/disconnection.\r\n* Power connection history saved in local database.\r\n* Receive notifications with/out sound or vibration.\r\n* Supports phones and tablets running Android 4.0 or later (API 14).\r\n\r\nThis app does NOT manage any other phone functionalities, such as WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS, etc. There are other apps for thatâ€¦\r\n\r\n##Links\r\n\r\n* [Website][link_snoozy_website]\r\n* [Privacy policy][link_snoozy_privacy]\r\n* [SnooZy Charger on Google Play][link_snoozy_playstore]\r\n\r\n[![Android app on Google Play][img_playstore_badge]][link_snoozy_playstore]\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\n* Developed by [Mudar Noufal][link_mudar_ca]  &lt;<mn@mudar.ca>&gt;\r\n* Many thanks to G&A!\r\n\r\nThe Android app includes (thanks!) libraries and derivative work of the following projects:\r\n\r\n* [AOSP][link_lib_aosp] &copy; The Android Open Source Project.\r\n* [Android Support Library v4][link_lib_supportv4] &copy; The Android Open Source Project.\r\n* [Android Asset Studio][link_lib_ui_utils] &copy; Google Inc, used to create icons assets.\r\n\r\nThese three projects are all released under the [Apache License v2.0][link_apache].\r\n\r\n##Code license\r\n\r\n    SnooZy Charger\r\n    Power Connection manager.
